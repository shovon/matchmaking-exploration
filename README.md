# Matchmaking

[View notebook here](https://github.com/shovon/matchmaking-exploration/blob/master/Matchmaking.ipynb)

In this repository, I explore the Elo matchmaking algorithm.

This is just me practicing data analysis/processing.

The dataset is from the *Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World* Kaggle competition, and you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chess/data).
